# Add a service to create the directory needed to store nginx
# certificates.  This is needed in case the BMC uses code update to go
# to a firmware image that uses nginx.  The directory must be created
# in the overlay filesystem (not in the generated file system) to
# survive the downgrade.  The service is "harmless" and only creates
# one additional subdirectory.

# This service can be removed in the first release that does not
# support a downgrade path to an OpenBMC 2.6 or earlier release.
